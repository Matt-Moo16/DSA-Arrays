2. Explore the push() method
Using the array class you just created above, add an item to the array.
Use the following function:

function main() {
    Array.SIZE_RATIO = 3;
    let arr = new Array();
    arr.push(3);
    console.log(arr)
}

~ What is the length, capacity and memory address of your array?
Answer: Array { length: 1, _capacity: 3, ptr: 0 }

~ Add the following in the main function and then print the array:

    arr.push(5);
    arr.push(15);
    arr.push(19);
    arr.push(45);
    arr.push(10);
~ What is the length, capacity and memory address of your array?
Explain the result of your program after adding the new lines of code.
Answer: Array { length: 6, _capacity: 12, ptr: 3 } result of push is pushed numbers being added to the beginning of the array

3. Exploring the pop() method
~ Add the following in the main function and then print the array:
    ...
    arr.pop();
    arr.pop();
    arr.pop();
~ What is the length, capacity, and address of your array? 
Explain the result of your program after adding the new lines of code.
Anser: Array { length: 3, _capacity: 12, ptr: 3 } result of calling pop is new values are added to the array as empty spaces, lengh decreased by 3 because of number of times called 

4. Understanding more about how arrays work
~ Print the 1st item in the array arr.
~ Empty the array and add just 1 item: arr.push('tauhida');
~ Print this 1 item that you just added. What is the result? Can you explain your result?
~ What is the purpose of the _resize() function in your Array class?

5. URLify a string 
A common mistake users make when they type in an URL is to put spaces between words or letters.
A solution that develpoers caan use to solve this problem is to replace any spaces with a %20. 
Write a method that takes in a string and replaces all its empty spaces with a %20.
Your algorithm can only make 1 pass through the string. 
Examples of input and output for this problem can be
    ~ Input: tauhida parveen 
    ~ Output: tauhida%20parveen
    ~ Input: www.thinkful.com /tauh ida parv een
    ~ Output: www.thinkful.com%20/tauh%20ida%20parv%20een

6. Filtering an array
Imagine you have an array of numbers. Write an algorithm to remove all numbers less than 5 from the array. 
DO NOT use Array's built-in .filter() method here, write the algorithm from scratch.

7. Max sum in the array
You are given an array containing positive and negative integers. 
Write an algorithm which will find the largest sum in a continuous sequence. 
    ~ Input: [4, 6, -3, 5, -2, 1]
    ~ Output: 12

8. Merge arrays
Imagine you have 2 arrays which have already been sorted. 
Write an algorithm to merge the 2 arrays into a single array, which shoule also be sorted. 
    ~ Input: [1, 3, 6, 8, 11] and [2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10]
    ~ Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11]

9. Remove characters
Write an algorithm that deletes given characters from a string. 
For example, given a string of "Battle of the Vowels: Hawaii vs. Gronzy" and the characters to be removed are "aeiou", 
the algorithm should transform the original string to "Bttl f th Vwls: Hw vs. Grzny". Do not use JavaScript's filter, split, or join methods.
    ~ Input: 'Battle of the Vowels: Hawaii vs. Gronzy', 'aeiou'
    ~ Output: 'Bttl f th Vwls: Hw vs. Grzny'

10. Products
Given an array of numbers, write an algorithm that outputs an array where each index
is the product of all the numbers in the input array except for the number at each current index.
See the following output.
    ~ Input: [1, 3, 9, 4]
    ~ Output: [108, 36, 12, 27]

11. 2D array
Write an algorithm which searches through a 2D array, 
and whenever it finds a 0 should set the entire row and column to 0.
    ~ Input:
        [[1,0,1,1,0],
        [0,1,1,1,0],
        [1,1,1,1,1],
        [1,0,1,1,1],
        [1,1,1,1,1]];
    ~ Output:
        [[0,0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,1,1,0],
        [0,0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,1,1,0]];

12. String rotation
Given 2 strings, str1 and str2, write a program that checks if str2 is a rotation of str1. 
    ~ Input: amazon, azonma
    ~ Output: False
    ~ Input: amazon, azonma
    ~ Output: true
